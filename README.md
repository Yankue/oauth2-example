# oauth2-example
A very easy way to do discord oauth2 in JavaScript!

## Usage
1) In main.js, put your credentials in, on lines 7-12
2) On the developer portal, set `http://localhost:3000/oauth-callback` to an OAuth2 redirect. Change the url/port how you wish.

This is clearly an example, but it shows exactly how to use the identify scope on Discord OAuth2.
